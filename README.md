# Imbalanced Classification Example

## Overview

This repository demonstrates handling imbalanced classification problems using the UCI Shuttle Dataset. The dataset consists of nine different types of classes with a significant imbalance among them (approximately 80% of the data belongs to class 1), making it an ideal example for practicing imbalanced classification techniques.

## Dataset

The UCI Shuttle Dataset contains data from the space shuttle and includes nine attributes, with one being the class label. The majority of the data belong to one class, creating an imbalanced dataset.

- **Dataset Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Statlog (Shuttle) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/148/statlog+shuttle)
- **Attributes:** 9 (8 numeric attributes and 1 class attribute)
- **Classes:** 7 (Significant imbalance in class distribution)

## Objective

To demonstrate techniques for managing imbalanced classification, such as resampling methods, cost-sensitive learning, and anomaly detection algorithms, using the Shuttle Dataset.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Loading:** Import the dataset for analysis and processing.
2. **Feature Scaling:** Standardize the data to ensure that the range of the feature values does not bias the model. 

## Handling Imbalanced Classification

1. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):**
   - Generate synthetic examples of the minority class to achieve balance between classes.
   
2. **Random Undersampling:**
   - Randomly reduce the number of instances in the majority class to equalize the class distribution.
   
3. **Class Weight Adjustment:**
   - Modify the algorithmâ€™s parameters to weigh the minority class more heavily, compensating for its underrepresentation.
